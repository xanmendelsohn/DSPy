# RAG with DSPy and Clarifai

This project demonstrates how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using DSPy and the Clarifai Python SDK. 

## Features
- Utilizes Clarifai's LLM models and vector database for efficient information retrieval and text generation
- Implements a RAG system that combines retrieval and generation capabilities
- Uses DSPy for streamlined development of NLP tasks

## Setup
1. Install required packages: clarifai, langchain, dspy-ai
2. Configure Clarifai credentials (PAT, User ID, App ID)
3. Ingest data into Clarifai's vector database
4. Initialize DSPy with Clarifai LLM model

## Usage
- Define custom signatures and modules for specific NLP tasks
- Use the RAG class to retrieve relevant context and generate answers based on user queries

This project showcases the integration of Clarifai's powerful AI capabilities with DSPy's flexible programming model for building advanced NLP applications.
