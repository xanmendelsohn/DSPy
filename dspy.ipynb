In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed. But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right -- and everyone, including Charley's mom, doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charley comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charley has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself.The cast led by Anton Yelchin (as Charley Brewster) & Colin Farrell (as Jerry) is great. The directing by Craig Gillespie is great. The story by Tom Holland (based on his original 1985 \"Fright Night\") & the screenplay by Marti Noxon is great.The music by Ramin Djawadi is great.

All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs, not to mention a few tears.  The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's (young and adult alike) every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.In short, 13 Going on 30 is a movie definitely worth watching!
